/* p5_9.c Using TPM2 Channel 0 to measure input period.
* This program uses TPM2 CH0 Input Edge-time Capture to measure
* the period of a periodic waveform.
* MCGFLLCLK (20.97152 MHz) is used as timer counter clock.
* Prescaler is set to divided by 64. So the timer counter is
* counting at 20.97152 MHz / 64 = 327,680 Hz.
* Timer 2 Channel 0 is configured as Input Edge-time Capture mode.
* and the input is using PTA1.
* When a rising edge occurs at PTA1, the timer counter value is
* copied to TPM2_C0V and the CHF is set.
* The program waits for CHF flag to set then calculates the
* difference of the current value to the previous recorded value.
* Bit 11-9 are used to control the tri-color LEDs.
* The LED should change color when the input frequency is changing
* below 642 Hz. Above 642 Hz, the number of clock cycles between
* rising edges is too small to reach bit 9.
